# Bowerbird-ID

This repository contains a set of scripts to implement a ML algorithm for the individual identification of spotted bowerbirds. The video bank was recorded in Australia between 2018 and 2021 using motion-triggered camera traps placed in front of the birds' bowers (structures built by males for mating displays). While many birds in the original footage had been manually identified with unique leg bands, some, especially females, remain unbanded, posing challenges to individual identification. 

The project aimed to automate the identification and classification of individual, unbanded, birds, to ease the study of these birds' behaviors.
